# Predicting Song Release Year using an MLP Model

## Description

This project uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to predict the release year of a song based on a dataset containing various musical features. Additionally, the CIFAR-10 dataset is used for image classification as a secondary example.

## Technologies Used

- **Libraries**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: TensorBoard
